# Shukra

### eBPF-powered runtime intelligence and security for KVM.

Shukra sits on the hypervisor and watches every QEMU/KVM workload from outside the guest.<br>
There is no agent to install in the VM. **Observe. Protect. Explain.**

## What Shukra is

The daemon attaches kernel traces, joins them to the QEMU process, and gives an operator a console and a CLI that say what they know, how they know it, and what they cannot see.

**8** eBPF programs · **35** kernel attach points · **0** agents in the guest · **17** console pages · **38** HTTP routes · **21** `shukractl` commands

## What it answers

| The question | Ask | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| Why is this VM slow right now? | `shukractl explain <vm>`: ranked host-side causes over the last minute, with evidence and a list of what Shukra cannot see | [Tutorial 4](docs/tutorials/04-shukractl.md) |
| Why *was* it slow at 03:12, hours ago? | `shukractl explain <vm> --at 2026-09-20T03:12:00Z`, and `shukractl incident <vm> --at -3h --out bundle.json` | [Tutorial 9](docs/tutorials/09-after-the-fact.md) |
| Which VM is the noisy neighbour? | `trace contention`, and `explain` (`noisy_neighbour`, `cpu_preempted`) | [Signals](docs/signals.md#vcpu-preemption) |
| Did the connection get an answer? | `trace tap`: accepted, refused, never answered or blocked, with the handshake time | [Lost traffic](docs/tutorials/08-lost-traffic.md) |
| Can I cut a compromised VM off without touching it? | `shukractl isolate <vm>` | [Guest traffic and isolation](docs/tap.md#isolate) |
| Is Shukra itself set up safely? | `shukractl doctor`: exposure, what is attached, what it cannot see, each with a fix | [Doctor](docs/doctor.md) |

All fifteen questions, with what to run for each: [What it answers](docs/what-it-answers.md).

<a id="what-it-does-not-do"></a>

## What it does not do

Read this before you trust it with anything.

- **Host TCP is QEMU's, not the guest's.** `tcp_v4_connect` and `tcp_v6_connect` events are `attribution: "qemu-process"` and `guest_attributed: false`. Only events seen on a VM's tap are `guest_attributed: true`. See [attribution](docs/attribution.md).
- **No agent, and no application data, with these exceptions.** Shukra never runs inside a guest and never reads what a guest says to the world. It reads four things beyond headers, and each has a switch: the name in a plain DNS query over UDP port 53 (`-dns-events=false`), the first segment of a TLS ClientHello (`-tls-events=false`), the names of the files a QEMU process opens, never their contents (`-vmm-tripwires=false`), and process names (`comm`).
- **Isolation is real, and conditional.** It really drops the VM's tap traffic, but only with an explicit management allow list (`-isolate-allow`), and only on Linux 6.6 or newer (TCX). Without an allow list it is refused.
- **Nothing acts unless you turn it on.** Responses, egress policy and baselines are off until you configure or apply them. A response can only isolate a VM, and by default it only proposes.
- **A VM Shukra cannot see says so.** User-mode networking has no tap, and `shukractl doctor` names it. **Percentiles can read up to 2x high**, because they come from log2 buckets.

The full list, with every caveat and what is not built yet: [What it does not do](docs/what-it-does-not-do.md).

## Requirements

| To get | You need |
|---|---|
| The daemon, CLI and API | Go 1.27+ to build (or a release tarball or `.deb`). Runs anywhere; programs are detached without BPF |
| The console | Node 22 to build it |
| `kvm`, `sched`, `block`, `net`, `vmm` | Linux with kernel BTF (`/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`), and `CAP_BPF` (5.8+) |
| `drops` | Linux 5.17+ (a drop reason on `kfree_skb`) |
| `tap`, guest traffic, egress policy and isolation | Linux 6.6+ (TCX), and `CAP_NET_ADMIN` |
| libvirt VMs' taps | `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` and `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` |
| Building the programs | Linux with `clang` and `bpftool` |

A program the kernel cannot support reports itself `detached` with the reason, and the others still run. See [architecture](docs/architecture.md#kernel-requirements).

## Quick start

Go 1.27+ and Node 22 for the console.

```bash
make build
make web
./bin/shukrad -listen 127.0.0.1:30970 -web web/dist
./bin/shukractl status
```

If `SHUKRA_API_KEY` is unset, the daemon uses the dev token `shukra` and says so on stderr. Open `http://127.0.0.1:30970` and sign in with that token. On a Mac, or any host without BTF, programs stay detached; VM discovery from `/proc` still works. To attach traces you need Linux, clang, bpftool and kernel BTF: see [Attach traces](docs/tutorials/02-attach-traces.md).

Shukra is a systemd unit on the hypervisor, not a Helm chart: eBPF has to run where the VMs run. Deploy with `./scripts/deploy-remote.sh 10.0.1.5 sus`; the walkthrough, the operator loop, rules and flags are in [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md).
